# DNA-Translation-Frames

This program to translate in each forward translational frame (1,2,3).  It translates in each reverse (complement) translation frame as well.  The program also handles 'N' symbols in the third position of a codon

If all four codons represented correspond to the same amino-acid, then it outputs that amino-acid. Otherwise, it outputs 'X'.
